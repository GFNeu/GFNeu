### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">, thank you for visiting this page!

I had my first lessons of HTML and CSS when studying Image and Sound Design at the university. After that, I continued programming as a hobby and this year I quit my day job as an event planner to become a Full-Stack Developer by enrolling in a full-time Coding Bootcamp (at Plataforma 5).

Since then I have been coding day and night to learn as much as I can, and **I AM LOVING IT!** ðŸš€
